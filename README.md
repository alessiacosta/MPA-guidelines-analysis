# Code to accompany the paper "Synthesising ecological, socioeconomic, and governance guidelines for designing Marine Protected Areas"

## The code

MPA-guidelines-analysis contains the scripts, data, and results that were used to conduct visual analyses to sythesise guidelines for the design of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). This review article assesses teh extent to which ecological, socioeconomic, and/or governance guidelines are integrates in teh current MPA design. This R project contains:
1. A folder titled "Code" that contains scripts used for the analyses
- documents.profile.qmd <- Figures to summarise the profile of the documents reviewed (including supplementary material 1 figure S1 and figure S2) based on document type, jurisdictional scale, MPA objective and design guidelines colour coded based on their different categories (i.e., ecological, socioeconomic, governance, and theri different combinations), and temporal distributions for both MPA objectives and design guidelines.
- pa.analysis.qmd <- Presence/Absence analysis figures for ecological, socioeconomic, and governance guidelines for their respective MPA objectives
- frequency.heatmap.qmd <- Frequency heatmap matrix that show the frequency use of design guidelines to achieve different MPA objectives across all three categories (i.e., ecological, socioeconomic, and governance)
2. A folder titleed "Data" with the data used for the analyses
3. A folder titled "Results" with the figures produced from the analyses
